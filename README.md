For this project, we will be attempting to evolve democracy! Yes, we will be building an online voting system despite knowing
absolutely nothing about HTML/CSS and JavaScript (vote rigging anyone?). With declining voter turnout and pesky automated
calls that seek to mislead voters - an easy to deploy and use, probably (not) secure, voting system is needed.

This web application will contain the following features: There will be an interface for an administrator to add candidates,
their platform and (empty) promises. The administrator will also be able to import a list of eligible voters, the backend
will then generate and email an unique url to each one of these users. The users will then be able to follow the link, view
each candidate, and their inspiring vision, then make up their mind. Of course, once the poll closes the results will be
displayed in a very pretty interface. While tempting, there will be no secret interface for rigging the votes, though it is
important to remember the phrase "every man has his price."

The proposed milestones for this assignment are as follows:

2. Pages designed/UI mockups: Feb 25

3. Framework demo (running application skeleton): March 4

4. Admin pages working: March 11

5. Vote pages working: March 18

6. Working prototype/demo: March 25

7. Draft documentation: April 1

8. Final code and documentation: April 10
