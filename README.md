For this project, we will be attempting to evolve democracy! Yes, we will be building an online voting system despite knowing
absolutely nothing about HTML/CSS and JavaScript (vote rigging anyone?). With declining voter turnout and pesky automated
calls that seek to mislead voters - an easy to deploy and use, probably (not) secure, voting system is needed.

This web application will contain the following features: There will be an interface for an administrator to add candidates,
their platform and (empty) promises. The administrator will also be able to import a list of eligible voters, the backend
will then generate and email an unique url to each one of these users. The users will then be able to follow the link, view
each candidate, and their inspiring vision, then make up their mind. Of course, once the poll closes the results will be
displayed in a very pretty interface. While tempting, there will be no secret interface for rigging the votes, though it is
important to remember the phrase "every man has his price."

The web browser will do nothing more than display the user interface in its various forms, the voting interface, result
interface, etc. The webserver will have to maintain state, to ensure the integrity of the voting system. The backend will use
SQL to store the list of voters, what they vote for, and the candidates.

The proposed milestones for this assignment are as follows:

1. Architecture diagram & external library/program use: Feb 11

2. Pages designed/UI mockups: Feb 25

3. Framework demo (running application skeleton): March 4

4. Admin pages fully designed and more or less functioning: March 18

5. Vote pages fully designed and more or less functioning: March 25

6. Working prototype/demo: April 1

7. Draft documentation: April 1

8. Final code and documentation: April 10
